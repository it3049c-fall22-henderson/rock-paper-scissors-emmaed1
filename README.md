## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?
The hardest part of this assignment was getting the game to actually run. A lot of the times, the page would refresh but not show the game screen. I made sure all my funcions were being called correctly and effectively. Other than getting the layout tests to pass, everything else went pretty smoothly. 

### How long it took us to finish this?
This took me the rest of the day to finsih. In total, maybe 4 hours on this assignment.
